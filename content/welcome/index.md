The goal of this project is to enable anyone to set up a free help center for their product. Help Centers are websites which contain documentation, ansers to frequent questions and tips for your product or service.

## Developing Skills?

Upskill Me partners with UK schools to help students aged 11 to 18 prepare for their next steps.

To be successful today, students need more than just good grades. They need to build sought-after interpersonal skills that they can take into jobs and universities. Thatâ€™s where Upskill Me comes in: our platform helps students develop and record these skills. Students can also record their achievements, and connect with employers, events, and courses. Through Upskill Me, young people succeed.

## What is it exactly?

I needed a help center for a project I'm working on, but I wasn't happy with the existing solutions. Most of them were paid SaaS-products, which offered way more features than I needed and had a hefty price tag. Instead, I set out to create a help center myself. I later converted it into a [Gatsby Starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/starters/) called [`gatsby-starter-help-center`](https://www.github.com/dferber90/gatsby-starter-help-center) and open-sourced it.
