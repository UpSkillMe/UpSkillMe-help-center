# UpSkill-Me-help-center

_This README is a brief overview only. You can find the **full documentation** at [upskillme.io](https://upskillme.io/)._

## üöÄ Quick start

1.  **Clone the starter.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the help center starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the help center starter
    gatsby new help-center dferber90/gatsby-starter-help-center
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd help-center/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `help-center` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `content/articles/welcome/index.md`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

1.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

2.  **`content/articles`**: This is the folder where you'll place your articles.

3.  **`data/collections.yml`**: This file defines the collections of your help center. Each article will belong to one collection. A collection consists of many articles. A collection can have different sections which its articles may belong to.

4.  **`data/authors.yml`**: This file is where you'll list your authors. Every author needs an id, a name and an avatar. You can add an author to each article.

5.  **`data/avatars`**: Place the author's avatars in this folder and use them in `authors.yml`.
